// Question 15
// What does it mean for Dart to be a statically-typed language, and how does it
// impact the way variables are used?


//Answer: it's type safe so it means Dart depend to be more safe and secure with static variable type
//furthermore it is flexible if you need a dynamic typing you can annotate any variable with dynamic keyword
//that can contain any datatype at runtime but in some scenario it will cause an error in runtime so that is 
//why static datatype more secure with compiletime.
